launch a local server using python 3

code -

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080



if you have started the server with

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 

then you can press ctrl + c to down the server.

But if you have started the server with

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &

or

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 & disown

you have to see the list first to kill the process,

run command

ps

or

ps aux | less

it will show you some running process like this ..

PID TTY          TIME CMD
7247 pts/3     00:00:00 python
7360 pts/3     00:00:00 ps
23606 pts/3    00:00:00 bash

you can get the PID from here. and kill that process by running this command..

kill -9 7247

here 7247 is the python id.

Also for some reason if the port still open you can shut down the port with this command

fuser -k 8888/tcp

here 8888 is the tcp port opened by python.

Hope its clear now.
